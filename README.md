## Queues & Lists Project

### Description
The "Queues & Lists" project implements various data structures and algorithms in C++. It includes the implementation of a Queue data structure, a recursive linear search function, and a modified insertion sort algorithm for lists.

### Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program that demonstrates the functionality of the implemented data structures and algorithms.
- `queue.h`: Header file for the Queue data structure template class.
- `insertion_sort.h`: Header file for the modified insertion sort algorithm.
- `queue.cpp`: Implementation file for the Queue data structure.
- `insertion_sort.cpp`: Implementation file for the modified insertion sort algorithm.

### Implemented Functionalities
1. **Queue Data Structure**:
   - Provides push(), pop(), front(), size(), and empty() functions.
   - Includes a function move_to_rear to move the front element to rear of the queue.
2. **Recursive Linear Search**:
   - Implements a recursive linear search function to find the last occurrence of a target in a vector.
3. **Modified Insertion Sort for Lists**:
   - Modifies the insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers
   - Demonstrates sorting a list using the modified insertion sort algorithm.
     
### Notes
- This project is educational and can be modified for learning or development purposes.
